        <h3>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h3>
        <li>CSS3 allows developers to make static elements on the page move around with just CSS and not a single line
            of JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Transforms don’t work on inline elements.</li>
        <li>Scaling and translating will not mess with the document flow. Whatever is being altered will not affect
            other elements on the page.</li>
        <li>Transforms are applied in the oder that they are provided.</li>
        <li>Only use or default to all when using a transition-property if you want animate every property. If you
            animate every property, then future supported properties could be inadvertently animated.</li>
        <li>200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything slower will make the website seem
            slow, drawing generally unwanted attention to what was supposed to be a subtle effect. Anything faster may
            be too subtle.</li>
        <li>With transitions there are no fine-grained control over any intermediate states.</li>
        <li>Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.</li>


        <h3>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, Drag and Drop</h3>
        <li>Canvas originated from a framework that Apple originally developed.</li>
        <li>You must set the width and the height of the canvas in order for it to have a custom size. You cannot use
            CSS to change the canvas size.</li>
        <li>Text that is inside of the canvas will only be displayed if the user's browser doesn't support it.</li>
        <li>Just like in real life, we have to saturate the brush with a color. In JavaScript we must do the same thing
            when using the canvas.</li>
        <li>The canvas coordinate system is different from the one that we all learned in math class.</li>
        <li>Squares and rectangles have built in draw functions but in order to do other shapes we have to specifically tell the JavaScript where to draw on the canvas.</li>
        <li>The canvas is not visible to screen readers. It does not create a DOM node so it's not very accessible.</li>
        <li>SVG's can become very complex, so there are image editing software that will make the creation process much easier.</li>
        <li>Canvas and SVG allow you to draw custom images to the screen, but each has their advantages and disadvantages so you have to pick one for the specific project that you will be working on.</li>
        <li>To make an image draggable, you must add the draggable attribute to the image tag and set it to true.</li>
        <li>Elements on the page by default cannot have items dropped on them, so we have to use preventDefault in order to allow the element to accept a drop.</li>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In today's websites, how often is the canvas used? I have never heard of the canvas, so I am wondering how common it is?</li>
            <li>It often that web developers create their own SVG's or is there often another designer that will do this?</li>
            <li>Is Drag and Drop what is mostly used by big companies on their websites? Is this just a low end and easy way to handle the drag and drop functionality?</li>
        </ul>
