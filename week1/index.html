    <h2>Week 1 Notes/Exercises</h2>

    <ul>
        <h3>How To Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX</h3>
        <li>Designing for the smallest device first will help lead to the development of simple, beautiful apps.</li>
        <li>Developers spent nearly 30 whole years designing for a single device.</li>
        <li>In 2007, the iPhone released, and this caused a huge decline in desktop usage.</li>
        <li>Now, instead of there being one device in a household, there are now 2 or 3 per person.</li>
        <li>Full mobile-first rewrites are time consuming and expensive.</li>
        <li>Start small and scale up.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>How to Improve UX by Understanding Users</h3>
        <li>Be There. You have to make sure that you are available to your customers with a mobile version of your site.
        </li>
        <li>Be Useful. Do not make your users hunt for content.</li>
        <li>Be Quick. Make processes simple and make the interactions with the site smooth and seamless.</li>
        <li>75% of people rely on their thumbs when using a mobile device.</li>
        <li>We need to design and develop apps according to how the general population interact with their devices.</li>
        <li>Reduce images on the site if possible.</li>
        <li>Optimize and minify CSS or JS files.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</h3>
        <li>We need to care about how users interact with the software that we create.</li>
        <li>Main nav bars are easier to access at the bottom of the screen.</li>
        <li>Moving primary controls helped Facebook create the illusion tha their site is faster.</li>
        <li>Buttons need to be wrapped in a border so that people know that the word Menu can be interacted with.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h3>
        <li>Focus on the important things first so that users don't have to think as much.</li>
        <li>With forms, we need to demand that users input less information.</li>
        <li>Giving the user some options will help you reduce the number of input fields.</li>
        <li>Paginate big forms and make the form seem less daunting. Use progress trackers.</li>
        <li>Enable autocomplete so that the users' phone can help them fill out the form.</li>
        <li>Show passwords by default, but allow them to hide the password if they need to.</li>
        <li>Do not force a copy and paste.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h3>
        <li>Before you advertise, research!</li>
        <li>Pop-up ads are not the way to advertise.</li>
        <li>Ads should not be where content needs to be.</li>
        <li>Ads should be small and simple. They can still be effective.</li>
        <li>Expanding ads are the way to go. They take up less space on the page once loaded and users can choose to
            expand the ad if they want.</li>
        <li>Users do not visit your website to look at ads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Are nav bars placed at the bottom of the screen the right way to go?</li>
        <li>What are the best resources to understand user experiences and preferences? Are their websites full of data or do developers need to conduct this research on their own?</li>
        <li>Is hiding and showing a password a default or built-in part of HTML5 or the browser?</li>
    </ul>
