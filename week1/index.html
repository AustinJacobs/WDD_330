        <h3>How To Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX</h3>
        <li>Designing for the smallest device first will help lead to the development of simple, beautiful apps.</li>
        <li>Developers spent nearly 30 whole years designing for a single device.</li>
        <li>In 2007, the iPhone released, and this caused a huge decline in desktop usage.</li>
        <li>Now, instead of there being one device in a household, there are now 2 or 3 per person.</li>
        <li>Full mobile-first rewrites are time consuming and expensive.</li>
        <li>Start small and scale up.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>How to Improve UX by Understanding Users</h3>
        <li>Be There. You have to make sure that you are available to your customers with a mobile version of your site.</li>
        <li>Be Useful. Do not make your users hunt for content.</li>
        <li>Be Quick. Make processes simple and make the interactions with the site smooth and seamless.</li>
        <li>75% of people rely on their thumbs when using a mobile device.</li>
        <li>We need to design and develop apps according to how the general population interact with their devices.</li>
        <li>Reduce images on the site if possible.</li>
        <li>Optimize and minify CSS or JS files.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</h3>
        <li>We need to care about how users interact with the software that we create.</li>
        <li>Main nav bars are easier to access at the bottom of the screen.</li>
        <li>Moving primary controls helped Facebook create the illusion tha their site is faster.</li>
        <li>Buttons need to be wrapped in a border so that people know that the word Menu can be interacted with.</li>
