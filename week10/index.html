        <h3>Client-side form validation</h3>
        <li>Validation done in the browser is call client-side validation.</li>
        <li>Validation done in the on the server is called server-side validation.</li>
        <li>Giving friendly and useful error messages will make filling out a form easier and faster for users.</li>
        <li>You can accomplish client-side validation with HTML5 built-in form validation or you can use customizable form validation in with JavaScript.</li>
        <li>required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.</li>
        <li>minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)</li>
        <li>min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types</li>
        <li>type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.</li>
        <li>pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.</li>
        <li>Developers should use the :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes in order to apply certain styles to data.</li>
        <li>With JavaScript, you can use the Constraint Validation API. Most browsers support it and contains methods and properties that will allow you to validate forms on the client-side.</li>
        <li>HTML5 validation techniques will usually fit your needs, but for anything that needs to be really customized, you should use JavaScript.</li>
        <li>You can also validate forms in JavaScript without an API. You simply write functions that handle the validation and have them update CSS styles.</li>

        <h3>Using Fetch</h3>
        <li>Basic fetch request:
            <pre>
    fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));

            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>The initial Response object does not contain actual JSON data. We have to use the json() method on the response to extract the JSON data.</li>
        <li>Files can be uploaded using an HTML input type="file"  input element, FormData() and fetch().</li>
        <li>Since headers can be sent in requests and received in responses, and have various limitations about what information can and should be mutable, headers' objects have a guard property. This is not exposed to the Web, but it affects which mutation operations are allowed on the headers object.</li>
        <li>Response.status, Response.statusText and Response.ok are the most common Response properties that are used.</li>
        <li>The Headers interface of the Fetch API allows you to perform various actions on HTTP request and response headers. These actions include retrieving, setting, adding to, and removing headers from the list of the request's headers.</li>

        


        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Are headers only useful when you are sending or retrieving data from a database, or would you use headers when retrieving data from a URL?</li>
            <li>What is the best option when using form validation? Is is standard to rely on the HTML5 built-in validation methods or do most people write their own validation code in JavaScript?</li>
            <li>When uploading JSON data, does the JSON.stringify(data) always need to be in the body?</li>
