        <h3>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h3>
        <li>Every JavaScript environment has a global object.</li>
        <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
            information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
        <li>You can use the BOM to see what pages were viewed before they the came to yours.</li>
        <li>Don’t rely on this information though, as it can be modified by a user to masquerade as a different browser.
            We should use a different method of determining what browser the user is using.</li>
        <li>window.location.href will return the URL that is in te browser search bar.</li>
        <li>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true, it
            will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.</li>
        <li>The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL.</li>
        <li>Using window.history.length will allow you to see how many pages were looked at before arriving at the
            current page.</li>
        <li>We can also hard code a back button so that the the user will move back or a forward button so that the user
            will move forward in the browser.</li>
        <li>Using window.open(), we can open up a new window and provide a width and height as well as an exact URL
            where we want to take the user.</li>
        <li>The close() method can be used to close a window, assuming you have a reference to it.</li>
        <li>The Screen object has more uses for mobile devices. It also allows you to do things like turn off the
            device’s screen, detect a change in its orientation or lock it in a specific orientation.</li>
        <li>You actually have to assign a cookie to the JavaScript Cookie Jar.</li>
        <li>To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past.</li>
        <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the
            clearInterval() method.</li>



        <h3>Chapter 14: HTML APIs</h3>
        <li>The information contained in the attributes can be used to identify particular elements.</li>
        <li>JSON.stringify is to set and item to local storage.</li>
        <li>JSON.parse is used to parse data when getting it from local storage.</li>
        <li>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere); THEN
            <pre>
            function youAreHere(position) {
                console.log(`Latitude: ${position.coords.latitude}, Longitude: ${position.coords.longitude}`); 
            }
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>The position object has several other properties that can be used to find out information about the location
            and movement of the device:

            position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second.

            position.altitude property returns an estimate of the device’s altitude in meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid,
            which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth.

            position.heading property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing in
            degrees, clockwise from North.

            position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded.</li>
        <li>We can use the Notification API to send notifications to the user's OS.</li>
        <li>This is a way to send a message to the user OS.
            <pre>
            if(window.Notification) {
                Notification.requestPermission()
                .then((permission) => {
                    if(Notification.permission === 'granted') {
                    new Notification('Hello JavaScript!');
                    }
                });
            }
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>This is how to create a nice looking notification.
            <pre>
            const notification = new Notification('JavaScript: Novice to Ninja',{
                body: 'The new book from SitePoint',
                icon: 'sitepointlogo.png'
            });
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Audio and video clips also have a number of events that will fire when they occur, including:

            The play event, which fires when the clip starts and when it resumes after a pause.

            The pause event, which fires when the clip is paused.

            The volumechange event, which fires when the volume is changed.</li>


        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I always thought that localStorage was a low tech way to store information, but is it being used more and more these days?</li>
