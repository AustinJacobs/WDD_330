        <h3>Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h3>
        <li>The reason that var wasn't totally removed from the language was because JavaScript needs to remain
            backwards compatible.</li>
        <li>When using the dot notations with numbers it is a good practice to use two dots so that the computer does
            not confuse the dot with a decimal point. There are many other ways to avoid this, but I like the double dot
            the most.</li>
        <li>It matters where you out the '++' or '--' because if you do ++points, the program will first increase points
            and then return it. Points++ will return points and then increase the value.</li>
        <li>Placing a '+' in front of "5" will turn it into a number.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, Loops</h3>
        <li>You can look at the values of an array in the console by simply typing the name of the array in the console.
        </li>
        <li>Using the join method with an array will turn all of the elements in the array into a long string.</li>
        <li>The slice method allows you to start and end with a specific index of an array.</li>
        <li>You can find if an array contains a value using the indexOf operator.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Chapter 4: Functions</h3>
        <li>Don't repeat yourself.</li>
        <li>You can use default parameters with ES6.</li>
        <li>Reduce iterates over each value in an array and the combines each result. I think that this could be really
            useful. </li>
        <li>Filter is useful for finding common things within an array. This could also be very useful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Say there is no function in the program yet. Are the declared variables considered local because they are
            all accessible?</li>
        <li>Is it just more effective to use template literals, or should we continue to use double or single quotes?
        </li>
        <li>Is learning the arrow function syntax expected or is that just another way to right functions? In other
            words, can it be based of off preference?</li>
    </ul>
