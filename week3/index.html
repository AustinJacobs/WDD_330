        <h3>Object Methods: this</h3>
        <li>A function that is a property of an object is called its method.</li>
        <li>Arrow functions don't have their own this. </li>
        <li>Methods allow objects to "act".</li>
        <li>Regular functions reference the window or global variable.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Chapter 5: Objects</h3>
        <li>If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method.</li>
        <li>If you try to access a property that doesn’t exist, undefined will be returned:</li>
        <li>hasOwnProperty() can be used to see of the object has a certain property. You can also use the 'in'
            operator.</li>
        <li>JSON is becoming increasingly popular as a data storage format, and many programming languages now have
            libraries dedicated to parsing and generating it.</li>
        <li>The parse()method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object.</li>
        <li>The stringify() method does the opposite, taking a JavaScript object and returning a string of JSON data.
        </li>
        <li>UTC is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Chapter 6: The Document Object Model</h3>
        <li>The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes
            that form a tree-like structure.</li>
        <li>This means it can be used in any programming language, not just JavaScript. I did not know this. I always
            thought that the DOM was only accessed with JavaScript and that there was no other way.</li>
        <li>It is super cool that you can access all of the elements on a page with the DOM and perform an action. This
            code could be very helpful: for (let i=0 ; i < document.images.length ; i++) { // do something with each
                image using document.images[i] }</li> <li>You can get and set attributes of an HTML element with the
                DOM.</li>
        <li>Code to create a function that makes elements on the HTML page: function createElement (tag,text) {
            const el = document.createElement(tag);
            el.textContent = text;
            return el
            }</li>
        <li>Every element node has a style property. This can be used to dynamically modify the presentation of any
            element on a web page.</li>
        <li>Camel case must be used when accessing css properties that normally contain a hyphen.</li>
    </ul>


    <ul>
        <h3>Chapter 7: Events</h3>
        <li>JavaScript uses anon-blocking approach that uses event listeners to listen out for any clicks on the page.</li>
        <li>Event listeners are added to elements on the page and are part of the DOM.</li>
        <li>I think that the updated way to use events makes far more sense than the old way. The new way at least makes a lot more sense to me.</li>
        <li>We should avoid using inline event handlers?</li>
        <li>You can find out the coordinates of a user click in at least three different ways.</li>
        <li>We should be careful using the click and dblclick on the same element.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have never heard of createTextNode(). In order to place text inside of an element with .innerHTML does a
            textNode need to be created for that element?</li>
        <li>What is the downside to using inline JavaScript onload=""?
        </li>
        <li>When would it be useful to know what keys were pressed? The chapter covered this extensively, but I still don't quite understand why it would be important?</li>
    </ul>
