        <h3>Object Methods: this</h3>
        <li>A function that is a property of an object is called its method.</li>
        <li>Arrow functions don't have their own this. </li>
        <li>Methods allow objects to "act".</li>
        <li>Regular functions reference the window or global variable.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Chapter 5: Objects</h3>
        <li>If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method.</li>
        <li>If you try to access a property that doesn’t exist, undefined will be returned:</li>
        <li>hasOwnProperty() can be used to see of the object has a certain property. You can also use the 'in' operator.</li>
        <li>JSON is becoming increasingly popular as a data storage format, and many programming languages now have libraries dedicated to parsing and generating it.</li>
        <li>The parse()method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object.</li>
        <li>The stringify() method does the opposite, taking a JavaScript object and returning a string of JSON data.</li>
        <li>UTC is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks.</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Chapter 4: Functions</h3>
        <li>Don't repeat yourself.</li>
        <li>You can use default parameters with ES6.</li>
        <li>Reduce iterates over each value in an array and the combines each result. I think that this could be really
            useful. </li>
        <li>Filter is useful for finding common things within an array. This could also be very useful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Say there is no function in the program yet. Are the declared variables considered local because they are
            all accessible?</li>
        <li>Is it just more effective to use template literals, or should we continue to use double or single quotes?
        </li>
        <li>Is learning the arrow function syntax expected or is that just another way to right functions? In other
            words, can it be based of off preference?</li>
    </ul>
