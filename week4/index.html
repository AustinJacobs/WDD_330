        <h3>Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
        <li>A button with the type of reset can be used to reset all the form fields. No additional code is needed.</li>
        <li>The placeholder functionality decreases significantly the amount of code needed to be written to have placeholder text in an input field. </li>
        <li>There are multiple types of input fields. </li>
        <li>Using the input type password, the text entered into the input field will be obfuscated.</li>
        <li>Checkbox information can be saved in an array and looped over to show them in the document.</li>
        <li>There is a basic API for form validation, but for more complex validation a custom one needs to be created.</li>
        <li>Forms are the best way to enter data into the browser so that it can be sent to the backend with JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <li>Class names should start with an uppercase letter.</li>
        <li>JavaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model.</li>
        <li>JavaScript's default is to make methods public, but they can be made private.</li>
        <li>Objects cannot have both a get() and set(). </li>
        <li>You can avoid creating classes all together and create objects from other objects.</li>
        <li>The main concepts of Object Oriented Programming are encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.</li>
        <li>Prototypes are live and this means that when properties and methods are added to it they are auto added to existing instances. </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Chapter 15: Modern JavaScript</h3>
        <li>The code in a module should have a single purpose. And functions should be grouped together based on their functionality.</li>
        <li>ES6 added support for module use in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.</li>
        <li>Using * you can import all values and functions from a file and you can give them a namespace.</li>
        <li>Having more than one default export will result in a syntax error.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Is there ever a time when it would be better to not use classes and use objects to create objects?</li>
        <li>How often are modules used in JavaScript? According to the book they are pretty new in JavaScript. I see that they could be very useful, but is it really useful to create a module for just a single value like PI?</li>
        <li>Is Object Oriented Programming the most common among programming types? Where does procedural programming fall on the list of most important programming types to learn?</li>
    </ul>
