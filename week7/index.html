        <h3>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h3>
        <li>All functions have a length property.</li>
        <li>The call() method will set the value of this inside a a function where the first argument is an object.</li>
        <li>The apply method works like the call method, but the arguments of the function are arrays.</li>
        <li>Self contained code blocks are useful because you can use temporary variables and also keep the scope of variables within a larger area. </li>
        <li>Writing pure functions is important if you choose to focus a program on functional programming. It is important to write pure functions because it will make the code cleaner and dependent only on itself and other functions.</li>
        <li>A callback is a function thatâ€™s provided as an argument to another function.</li>
        <li>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as a series of functions.</li>

        <h3>Chapter 13: Ajax</h3>
        <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</li>
        <li>Ajax was a neat acronym that referred to the different parts of the process being used: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.</li>
        <li>In order to check if the response was successful, we have to use the status property.</li>
        <li>A fetch API uses promises to avoid callback function usage.</li>
        <li>HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response. Typical information contained in headers includes the file-type of the resource, cookie information, authentication information and when the resource was last modified.</li>
        <li>In the fetch API, there has to be an object created that contains the request information.</li>
        <li>in the fetch API object, the URL is the first argument and it always required.</li>
        <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</li>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Why would we want to ever use the redirect method in the FetchAPI?</li>
        <li>Why do browsers not currently support the redirect method?</li>
